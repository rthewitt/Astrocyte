The core of the lesson business.  Client / Server, archetypes.  Some content.

This code is ancient scraps of an experimental prototype.  After working for Big Auto and Big Government I was eager to roll my hands up and learn the internals of git.  This is one component of a massive project that let me play with Git, configuration management, Spring Framework, VPNs, and JavaScript applications - (Applications in the browser! Ha!)

Something something community college courses on the internet.  EduTech was exciting then.

I had several versions of this, one used Portlet (JSR286), one was just Tomcat servlets / JSP, one was Python. This is whatever was sitting on an old VM disk I was inspecting.

This was at a time when I thought learning design patterns and enterprise architectures was the same as learning computer science.  After discovering functional programming & Clojure, I deleted Eclipse and never looked back.
